## What happens when  a user is deleted?

When a user is deleted, their Batch Changes become inaccessible in the UI but the data is not permanently deleted.
This allows recovering the Batch Changes if the user is restored.

However, if the user deletion is permanent, deleting both account and data, then the associated Batch Changes are also permanently deleted from the database. This frees storage space and removes dangling references.

## Are there any limitations with the Batch Changes feature?

- **Code hosts**: Batch Changes currently support **GitHub**, **GitLab** and **Bitbucket Server and Bitbucket Data Center** repositories. If you're interested in using Batch Changes on other code hosts, [let us know](https://about.sourcegraph.com/contact).
- **Server-side execution**: Batch change steps are run locally (in the [Sourcegraph CLI](https://github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli)) or [server-side](/batch_changes/explanations/server_side) `Beta`. For this reason, the APIs for creating and updating a batch change require you to upload all of the changeset specs (which are produced by executing the batch spec locally). Also see [how scalable is Batch Changes](/batch_changes/references/faq#how-scalable-is-batch-changes-how-many-changesets-can-i-create).
- **Multi-user access**: It is not yet possible for multiple users to edit the same batch change that was created under an organization.
- It is not yet possible to reuse a branch in a repository across multiple batch changes.
- The only type of user credential supported by Sourcegraph right now is a [personal access token](/batch_changes/how-tos/configuring_credentials), either per user, or via a global service account. Further credential types may be supported in the future.
